# 📚 Library & Polymorphism Demo in Python

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python, such as **classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.  

It includes two main activities:  

1. **Library System (Books & Children Books)**  
   - A `Book` class with attributes like title, author, genre, and pages.  
   - Methods for borrowing, returning, and displaying book details.  
   - A `ChildrenBook` class that inherits from `Book` and adds extra behavior (like reading with understanding).  

2. **Polymorphism with Animals**  
   - A base class `Animal` with a `move()` method.  
   - Subclasses (`Fish`, `Bird`, `Cow`, `Snake`) override `move()` to perform different actions (swimming, flying, walking, slithering).  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Create books and manage their borrowing status.  
- Extend books with a `ChildrenBook` subclass.  
- Show different movement behaviors in animals through polymorphism.
